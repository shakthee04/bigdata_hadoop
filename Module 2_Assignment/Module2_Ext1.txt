The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from 4 to 18 strings, usually having 6. 
The sound is projected either acoustically or through electrical amplification (for an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar, respectively). 
It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the right hand while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand.
 The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. 
The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.
