--------If all of the fields are of numeric types, we could simply do something like

data1 = foreach data generate (int) $0,(int)$1,(int)$2,(int)$3;

filtered = FILTER data1 BY $1*$2 is not null;

------we could also write a UDF to take an arbitrary number of arguments and return null

REGISTER Numerofnull.jar;

filtered = FILTER data1 BY NUMBER_OF_NULLS($1, $2) == 0;
